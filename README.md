# Setup Instructions For Font
# Please do this or it will look awful when printing text

Also I know it's not good to install stuff locally because then everyone has to do it
but I'm telling you I tried my best. I hate to be that guy but cmu_graphics does NOT 
work when it comes to fonts. So I'm sorry about that.

1. Download the font file `Bytesized-Regular.ttf` in this folder.
2. Double-click the font and click "Install" to install it on your computer.
3. Run `main.py`. The pixel font should now appear in the game.

# Sources

While I don't have any sources for code as I coded this all by myself, I did take
a whole lot of inspiration for level design from the Pico-8 version of Celeste. 
That's what all the image files are. It was made by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry. 
Also all the sounds were from that game as well. The link to the original game is below:
